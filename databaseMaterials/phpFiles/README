The file service.php is an example that works that I found online that Ill explain a bit to get you going
	Line 4 needs to be replaced with username, password, and bd as required
	Line 13 needs to be replaced with the table
	So how it works is I input http://localhost/service.php and it returns the info in a json format.
		This doesn’t seem very secure which is kinda weird, so it might be a little wrong.
		For mac, I just put this in my /library/WebServer/Documents dir and it works

Here is a link to another set of examples that looks more legit: http://swiftdeveloperblog.com/store-user-information-in-mysql-database/
	It seems like its often php files that directly return the information desired, but i have seen thing where the file actually ends in .json, so you’d probably know more about that stuff than me


So related to the example in that link above this is what I THINK ill need, Im still trying to understand this whole http body and request crap

1.
Similar to userRegister.php but maybe include some other columns that are in the DB you made
It looks like there is supposed to be some kind of HTTPMethod referred to as “POST” and the HTTPbody is where i input the username, password and stuff. - this is where I was mainly confused, not sure what an HTTP post request is?

2.







Just start looking at this stuff and see if it makes sense to you. It’ll probably be easier for us to work together on this.



Love,
Nick
